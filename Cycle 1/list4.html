In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, usually supporting
branches and leaves. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including
only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a
specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are
also trees. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have
independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to
compete for sunlight.
