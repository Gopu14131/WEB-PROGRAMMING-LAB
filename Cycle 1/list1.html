Fruits are the means by which flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) disseminate
their seeds.Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans
and animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one
group and nutrition for the other; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent
on fruits as a source of food
